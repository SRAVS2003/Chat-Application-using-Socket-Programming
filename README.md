# Chat-Application-using-Socket-Programming
A chat application using socket programming involves establishing a real-time, two-way communication channel between multiple clients and a central server. This typically utilizes the client-server model, where the server acts as a central hub facilitating message exchange among connected clients.
Key Components:

Server:

Listens for incoming client connections on a specific port.
Accepts new client connections and creates a dedicated thread or process to handle each client concurrently.
Receives messages from clients and broadcasts them to other connected clients, or routes them to specific recipients for private chats.
Manages client states, such as usernames and connection status.

Client:

Connects to the server using the server's IP address and port number.
Sends messages to the server.
Receives messages from the server and displays them to the user.
Manages user input and displays chat history.

Common Technologies and Concepts:

Sockets:
The fundamental building blocks for network communication, allowing programs to send and receive data over a network.

TCP/IP:
The internet protocol suite used for reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data streams between applications.

Multithreading/Concurrency:
Essential for handling multiple client connections simultaneously on the server side, ensuring responsiveness and preventing blocking.

Serialization/Deserialization:
Converting data structures or objects into a format that can be transmitted over the network and then reconstructing them on the receiving end.

Implementation Steps (General Outline):

Server Setup:
Create a server socket and bind it to a specific port.
Implement a loop to continuously listen for and accept new client connections.
For each accepted connection, create a new thread to handle communication with that client.

Client Setup:
Create a client socket and connect to the server's IP address and port.
Implement threads for sending and receiving messages concurrently.
